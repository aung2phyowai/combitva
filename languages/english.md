# Instructions

Thank you for participating in this study.<br /><br /> \
\
In the following experiment, a red cross will be displayed in the center of the screen. Please fix your gaze on this red cross during the experiment. Shortly after the cross is displayed, either <i>two</i> or <i>six</i> <span color="red">red letters</span> will appear on an invisible circle surrounding the cross. In some trials, in which only two red letters are shown, four <span color="blue">blue letters</span> will be displayed simultaneously. All letters will be visible for a short amount of time only.<br /><br /> \
\
Your task will be to pay attention to the <span color="red">red letters</span>. After the presentation, please report which red letters you saw. Report only those letters of which you are fairly certain that they were presented. Please make sure that 80-90% of the letters you report are correct.<br /><br /> \
\
Following every block, you will receive feedback about the accuracy of your answers that is how many of the reported letters were indeed presented.<br /><br /> \
\
Altogether the experiment consists of 13 blocks lasting 3 minutes each. The first block is a practice block to familiarize yourself with the task. After each block you will be able to take a brief break. The entire experiment will last about 40 Minutes.<br /><br /> \
